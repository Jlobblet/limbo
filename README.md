# Limbo

A compiler for the Limbo programming language.  You can read about Limbo [here](http://doc.cat-v.org/inferno/4th_edition/limbo_language/).

This is extremely unfinished.

Why did I write this in C?
Pain awaits.

## Installation

There is nothing to install yet.

## Configuration

There is nothing to configure yet.

## Compilation

Standard CMake out of source build.

```shell
$ mkdir cmake-build-debug
$ cd cmake-build-debug

## Usage
